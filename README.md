## HTML Structure<a name="html-structure"></a>
The HTML file starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and contains a series of HTML elements that define the structure and content of the web page.

The main container is wrapped in a `<div class="main-container">` element. Inside this container, various sections and elements are present, forming the website layout.

## Navbar<a name="navbar"></a>
The navigation bar or navbar is defined within a `<nav>` element. It consists of a logo, a list of navigation links, and some icons. The navbar is structured using unordered lists (`<ul>`) and list items (`<li>`). The dropdown menus are created using nested lists.

The navbar also includes font icons from Font Awesome for the hamburger menu, shopping bag, and search icon. External stylesheets are linked for custom fonts and animations.

## Pick Animation<a name="pick-animation"></a>
The pick animation section includes two main-pic elements with different classes: `pick-main1` and `pick-main2`. These elements represent two variations of a hero section with animated text and buttons. The content is centered within a container (`<div class="pick-content-box">`) and includes heading, paragraph, and button elements.

## Development Section<a name="development-section"></a>
The development section contains information about the agency's services. It consists of a container (`<div class="devel-container">`) with a box (`<div class="devel-box">`) that holds two smaller boxes (`<div class="devel-sm-box">`).

The left `devel-sm-box` includes an image (`<img>`) and the right `devel-sm-box` contains a title, description, and a button.

## Creative Section<a name="creative-section"></a>
The creative section highlights different aspects of the agency's work. It consists of a container (`<div class="creative-container">`) with a box (`<div class="creative-box">`) that holds three smaller boxes (`<div class="creative-sm-box">`).

Each `creative-sm-box` includes an icon, a heading, a description, and a button. The icons are displayed using Font Awesome icons.

## Wedding Section<a name="wedding-section"></a>
The wedding section showcases specific design projects. It includes a container (`<div class="wedd-container">`) with two boxes (`<div class="wedd-box1">`) arranged side by side.

The first box (`wedd-box1 wedd-hover`) includes an image and a content box with a title and a link. The second box contains two smaller boxes (`<div class="wedd-sm-box1 wedd-sm-box2">`) arranged vertically. Each smaller box includes an image and a content box with a title and a link.

## Clients Section<a name="clients-section"></a>
The clients section displays testimonials from clients. It consists of a container (`<div class="client-container">`) with a content box (`<div class="client-content-bx">`) containing a title and a heading.

The testimonials are displayed in a slider (`<div class="slider">`) using multiple slides (`<div class="slide

">`). Each slide contains a client's photo, name, title, and testimonial.
